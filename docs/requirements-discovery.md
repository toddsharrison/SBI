# Discovery & Requirements Questionnaire

Use this worksheet to capture everything we need to replicate (and improve on) the existing PowerBI experience. We can iterate on it togetherâ€”start with rough notes and refine over time.

## 1. Dashboard Inventory
| Dashboard | Purpose / Story | Primary Stakeholders | Notes on Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |

*For each dashboard, attach screenshots or existing URLs when possible.*

## 2. Data Sources & Refresh Cadence
| Source System | Connection Details | Update Frequency | Transformations in PowerBI | Sensitive Fields |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |

*Document the SQL views/tables behind each source. Highlight anything calculated inside PowerBI that must move into our new pipeline.*

## 3. Filters, Drilldowns & Interactions
- Global filters (date ranges, mission identifiers, etc.)
- Cross-filtering behaviour between visuals
- Drill-through pages or detail views
- Custom tooltips, annotations, conditional formatting

## 4. Target Users & Access Patterns
| Audience | Access Method (web, mobile, kiosk) | Authentication / Authorization Needs | Accessibility / Branding Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- Data freshness expectations (e.g., "no older than 15 minutes")
- Performance SLAs (initial load time, interactions)
- Availability / uptime targets
- Audit, compliance, or export control considerations

## 6. Data Quality & Governance
- Known data quality issues or validation rules
- Ownership for each dataset (who can confirm accuracy?)
- Required lineage / catalog tools

## 7. Operational Considerations
- Current deployment / release process for PowerBI artefacts
- Desired environments (dev/staging/prod)
- Alerting or monitoring expectations

## 8. Future Enhancements & Nice-to-haves
- Features that are not critical for launch but should stay on the roadmap
- Integration points with other systems or APIs

Once this questionnaire is filled in, we can translate it directly into user stories and a phased delivery plan.
